# Tiago Rinaldi

## This is a **contribution** page. Don't expect copy/paste from that super duper tutorial in which you create a clone app \*gasps\*.

- ðŸ”­ **Iâ€™m currently working on** learning stuff, trying to contribute as much as I can. Pet projects are included here because they're fun and/or useful. This is not a `Hello, World` repo. Sorry, LinkedIn person.
- ðŸ’¬ **Ask me about** anything
- ðŸ“« **How to reach me:** trinaldi.github.io - easy to read and also easy find ways to contact me, I swear.
- âš¡ **Fun fact:** Free time is an expensive commodity :)
